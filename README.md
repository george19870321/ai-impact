AI and the Future of Work.
Jupyter Notebook examines how Artificial Intelligence is changing the workplace. Analysis of AI impacts across different job sectors reveals both opportunities and challenges of increased AI integration. The research starts with the AI Impact metric that measures how AI influences tasks across job roles. Notably, Communications, Data and IT and Administrative roles have the highest AI penetration with up to 98% of tasks automated. Industries like hospitality and healthcare are meanwhile largely human-centric and AI only affects about 10% of tasks.

The analysis finds a strong correlation between the number of tasks per job and also the number of AI models implemented - more complex, task-heavy roles are more vulnerable to automation. Also, it investigates how AI impact influences workload ratios, suggesting that as AI improves productivity, human workload may decrease, leading to a more efficient work environment. Predicted job roles vulnerable to AI transformation were identified as Data Collectors / Mail Clerks / CEOs using advanced machine learning models such as Random Forest and XgBoost.

The notebook also includes SHAP analysis to gain insight into feature importance and a 3D visualization of industry interactions of AI Impact/Workload Ratio & AI Model Density. These visualizations show how AI will one day automate tasks but also reshape job functions to improve human work instead of replacing it. In general, this analysis offers a nuanced vision of the future of work - AI will change and improve job roles, boosting efficiency and productivity across industries.
